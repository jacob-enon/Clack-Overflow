# Clack-Overflow
A forum to discuss mechanical keyboards, whilst trying to get trustworthy help sooner and avoid repetitive questions

## Purpose
There are a couple of drawbacks to r/mechanicalkeyboards to obtain help (not that it's anything but a wonderful community that I'm excited to be a part of). The main issues I see are:
- The same questions are asked frequently
- Anyone can answer a question

### Repetitive questions
I'm always happy to help people where I can, as are most members of this community. However, there are times where people could have done a basic search/a little research themselves to find the answer and save some time. This would also be helpful for the asker: if they can access an accepted answer instantly, they needn't wait for someone to answer their question. Everyone can get on with tuning stabs in peace.

### Lack of reputation
Anyone can answer a question. Mostly, this is great - I personally learnt a lot not only by asking, but by answering questions and realising where my knowledge gaps were. However, sometimes, people just give bad answers. We were all inexperienced once, and everyone's bias and personal experience can give some misleading advice every now and then (I once saw someone who "programmed and ocassionally did some casual gaming" get recommended a gaming keyboard with the lightest possible actuation. That's just... no).
Whilst I still want to encourage everyone to be involved in discussions and advice, and a range of opinions is what makes this community so diverse and fantastic, I think a reputation system would perhaps improve people's experience and make it easier to give the right advice (and perhaps reward more active and helpful members).
